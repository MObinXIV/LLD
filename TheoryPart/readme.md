# How to ace lld Questions 


## The theory part to ace LLD Problems 

1. OOAD & oop
2. ample Acknowledge to design patterns to -> Solve & write code 
3. Understanding Solid Principles 

## GKCS(The standard approach)

1. Get the requirements & implement them through **Use-case** diagram
2. Note The state & The behavior required-> State: variable in class or data entry in dataBase , Behaviour: Function that uses the variables or data entry . We Capture that through **Class Diagram**
3. **Optional Step** , define complex behaviours , using activity diagram

- The Most important part is **Class**


## SudoCode 

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Laying down Use cases
3. Uml/ Class Diagram
4. OOD to model the problem 
5. Implement Code(Design patterns + Solid Principles)


## Hints

Make Sure That objects and classes don't know a lot about each other , and the messages between classes can be reduced as much as possible
