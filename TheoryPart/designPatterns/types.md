# Types of Design Patterns 

Design patterns solve the problem of how you're going to organize your classes & objects and their behaviors 
and their communication between each other , we can break design patterns in terms of those categories.

So we 'll categorize them according to the **purpose**.

---

## Creational

Used for creating or instantiating objects & classes.

---

## Structural

Used to structure more than one class or object together.Moreover we will delve deep into inheritance , isp etc, while we study.

---

## Behavioral

Used for identifying and setting up common communication patterns among objects.

---

## between objects & classes 

there are only few patterns applicable to class and also , can't be applied to objects 

1. creational -> Factory method
2. Structural -> Adapter(Class)
3. Behavioral -> Interpreter & Template method

### why We categorize according to class and object 

1. creational

- classes-> Used for creating classes 
- objects -> used to create objects 

2. Structural 

- classes -> tell U how to use inheritance 
- objects -> used to organize and assemble different objects.

3. Behavioral 

- classes -> tell U how to use inheritance in order to implement algorithms & the control and flow of classes 
so as to fulfill certain behavior
- objects -> how to write an algorithms around objects in order to fulfill a task which one single object can't fulfill.

## Important note 

80% of the problems can be handled with 20% of the design patterns , we wont need all the patterns.
