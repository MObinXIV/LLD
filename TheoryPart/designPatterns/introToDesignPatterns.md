# Why , What & How


## What

Each Pattern describes a problem that occurs over & over multiple times in our environment.

And core of the solution to that problem can be used million times without ever doing it same twice.


## Why

- It helps to solve issues related to software development design with standard templates , proven by experts. (Solve them in the way experts do)

- help to express our idea with other developers.

- makes U a better designer.


- It help U learn and use frameWork Faster.

## How

To implement the design patterns properly, we need to take care  about & follow some conventions

1. Name -> it's the handle we use to describe design problem,it's solutions & consequences in word or two.It helps when we communicate with friends or even in interviews , maybe we know the pattern , but when we asked without knowing the name we can't answer.
2. Problem -> describe when to apply the pattern.(Problems in all cites are common in nature)
3. Solution -> describe the elements that make up the design, their relations, responsibilities & collaborations.(**We can map the problem to it's solution**).
4. Consequences -> results & trade-offs of applying the pattern.any solution 'll has it's cons at the end (nothing is perfect ,dude).
