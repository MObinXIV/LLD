# Singleton

Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. solve this issue using the class.


## Why 

It's important for some classes to have exactly one instance.there should be only one file system in windows manager.

If we wanna access a calender we have only one calender for all , which no one have access to modify it.


## Hints 

Singleton class never accepts parameters

if it accepts parameters, then it's a factory.so avoid it.
