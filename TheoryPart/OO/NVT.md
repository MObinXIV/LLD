- Briefly -> Class is the bluePrint and object is the resulting shape from this bluePrint , like the class car make a lot of **object** cars with different behaviors like colors , brand ...etc.

- Object -> what we see in the real world anything have some info & do some behaviors is object at the end. so object comprises of 2 things , **attributes or information and behaviors or properties** 
- Class -> Template or the bluePrint which create the object 

- Example -> Cookie cutter which create multiple cookies
