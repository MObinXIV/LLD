# Polymorphism (OverLoading & Overriding)

- Is actually the implementation of inheritance 

Multiple people use the same class 

- overloading -> have function do the same thing but in different manners , order function -> order(total ) , order (total , delivery coast ) 
- Overriding -> We make a virtual function in base class(Abstract Base class(pure virtual) we can't intialize object from it ) & change it's code in other derived classes , The function in the derived class replaces the virtual one in the base class.
