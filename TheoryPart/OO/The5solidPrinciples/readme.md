# Strategy for OO

1. Doing the proper analysis.
2. Developing statement of work that describes the system
3. Gathering requirements from this statement of work
4. Developing a prototype for user interface 
5. Identify classes.
6. Determining the responsibility of each class.
7. Determining how various classes interact with each other (relations).
8. Creating high-level model that describes the system to be built.

## The process of OO analysis and design can be described as

1. Identifying the objects in a system;
2. Defining relationships between objects 
3. Establishing the interface of each object 
4. Making design which can be converted to executables OO languages.
