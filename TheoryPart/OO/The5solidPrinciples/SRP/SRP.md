# Single Responsibility Principle

A module should deal with one and only one actor .(the module change according to only one actor)

## Why 

We Use it to keep the functionalities of our code consistent and don't violet each other by changing one thing related to one actor , don't affect other actors work.

## summary

any class which composed with functions responsible for multiple tasks better to separate it this class to multiple classes.
