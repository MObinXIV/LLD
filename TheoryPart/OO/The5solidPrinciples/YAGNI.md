# You're not gonna need it 

YAGNI is similar to the KISS principle in that they both aim for simpler solutions, with **YAGNI focusing on a specific aspect, which is the removal of unnecessary functionality and logic.**



## Avoid over-engineering a solution

The idea behind YAGNI is that you should only **implement functionality when you need it and not just because you think you may need it some day**. Ron Jeffries, one of the co-founders of XP, once said:
>"Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."


You don't want to spend time on future scenarios that are unknown. The problem with implementing a feature that you think might eventually be needed is that quite often the feature ends up not being needed or the requirements for it change.


Spending time and money on a feature you don't need takes away from time and money you could have spent
on something that you do need. Resources are finite, and using them on something that is
unnecessary is a waste.

Conclusion -> don't waste your time by a future feature which you don't need it now.

## Situations where YAGNI doesn't apply

YAGNI applies to presumptive features, as in functionality that is not currently needed. **It does not apply to code that would make the software system easier to maintain and modify later.**
In fact, following YAGNI means you may be changing the system later to add a feature, so the system should be well designed for this purpose.


conclusion -> Use YAGNI when U feel the function is consuming , but if the code would make the software maintainable later don't use it
