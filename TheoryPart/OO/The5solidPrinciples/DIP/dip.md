# Dependency inversion principle

The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead(which hold the methods which we need to implement) of concrete classes and functions.

## Why

If we don't follow up this principle we 'll need a lot of effort to change our code flow and testing.


- make the Dependency on interfaces instead of concrete classes
