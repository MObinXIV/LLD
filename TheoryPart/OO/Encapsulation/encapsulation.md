# Why we Use Encapsulation (Control & abstraction)

Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulates them

- Access modifiers & setters & getters 



## Difference between encapsulation & abstraction :(The whole & part)

| Abstraction | Encapsulation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Abstraction is the process or method of **gaining** the information. | While encapsulation is the process or method to **contain** the information.|
| In abstraction, problems are solved at the **design or interface level**.  | While in encapsulation, problems are solved at the **implementation level.**|
|Abstraction is the method of **hiding the unwanted information**. |Whereas encapsulation is a **method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside.**|
|We can implement abstraction using **abstract class and interfaces.** |Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. **private, protected and public.**|
|In abstraction, implementation **complexities are hidden using abstract classes and interfaces.**|**While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.**|
|The objects that help to perform abstraction are encapsulated. |Whereas the objects that result in encapsulation need not be abstracted.|
