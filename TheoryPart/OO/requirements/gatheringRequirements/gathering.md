# requirements gathering 

it's usually a single thing & U can test that thing to make sure U 've actually fulfilled the requirement

- creating requirements list -> write on it what the customer want & leave spaces for the case of new demands.

- sometimes the customers doesn't know what they really want, so U have to ask them questions to figure out what they want before U can determine exactly what the system should do.

- The best way to get good requirements is to understand what the system is supposed to do.
- U 're supposed also to handle the system requirements beyond what the customer want , by also , engage how the system will respond when things go wrong.

## Use Case 

a steps that the system takes , to make something happen(Describes what your system does to accomplish particular customer goal)

**technique for capturing the potential requirements of a new system or software change. each use case provide one or more scenario that convey how the system should interact with the end user or another system to achieve specific goal**
 
### Use Case (3 parts)

1. clear value -> help the user to achieve their goals , else it'sn't a use case.
2. Start & stop ->  starting & stopping point , something must begin the process & then there's must be a process that indicates that process is complete.
3. external initiator -> everything starts with thing outside the system , sometimes , it's a person or anything else outside the .

- **not as use case diagram**

## Conclusion 

U have to know what the user want & analyze it with yourself to not only deliver a system work , but also handle the things when it go wrong.
